  <h2>About me</h2>
  <hr>
  <div class="text">
    <p>I'm currently 22 years old and was born in San Antonio, Texas. I got my first "modern" PC, 
      way back in 2007, an old acer desktop that I used to play games like Command & Conquer and Stronghold
      Crusaders on and I've been obsessed with technology ever since. I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio from 
      2018 - 2023 and will graduate this may with a Bachelors of Business in Cybersecurity.

      I have work experience in a few different areas such as Retail, Data Analytics, and most recently 
      Penetration Testing.</p>
