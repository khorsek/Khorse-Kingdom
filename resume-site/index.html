  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="text">
    <p>I'm currently 22 years old and was born in San Antonio, Texas. I got my first "modern" PC, 
      way back in 2007, an old acer desktop that I used to play games like Command & Conquer and Stronghold
      Crusaders on and I've been obsessed with technology ever since. I attended the University of Texas at San Antonio from 
      2018 - 2023 and will graduate this may with a Bachelors of Business in Cybersecurity.

      I have work experience in a few different areas such as Retail, Data Analytics, and most recently 
      Penetration Testing.</p>

<b>Projects</b><br/>
<li><u>May 2023</u> - Implemented a Microsoft Sentinel SIEM to display global attack data based on location and magnitude of attacks.
  <br/>Entire process documented in my GitHub link above.

  Performed the following tasks for Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM):
  
  Used a custom Powershell script to extract metadata from Window's Event Viewer and then forwarded that data to a third party api to derive geolocation data.
  
  Configured the Log Analytics Workspace in Azure to take in custom logs containing geographic information like the latitude, longitude, state, and country.
  
  Created custom fields in Log Analytics Workspace so that I can map the harvested data in Microsoft Sentinel.
  
  Configured a Microsoft Sentinel workbook to display global attack data on a world map depending on the physical location and magnitude of attacks

<b>Professional Experience</b><br/>
<li><u>June 2022 - August 2022</u> - Cybersecurity Intern working in the Penetration Testing Team at Ernst and Young.
  <br/>
  As an intern, I worked alongside experienced Penetration Testers on their engagement which focused on Web API
   Penetration Testing. Learned how to use a combination of search engines like Censys and Shonan with Google 
   Dorking to learn effective reconnaissance techniques, as well as some tools like Ffuf, Dirb, and others to 
   probe for potential targets. 
</li>
<br/>
<li><u>September 2021 - April 2022</u> - Data Analyst Intern working at the Veteran's Health Administration.
  <br/>
  As an intern, I worked alongside the individuals running the Health Professional Scholarship Program (HPSP), 
  helping deliver scholarships to graduating medical students and ushering in the next generation of the VHA's 
  medical staff through data entry and analysis, using Excel, InDesign, and Photoshop as part of this process. 
</li>
<br/>
<li><u>October 2019 - September 2021</u> - Lot Associate working at The Home Depot.
  <br/>
  As a lot associate, I was responsible for assisting customers with loading their bought goods, as well as monitoring 
  and maintaining the entrance of the store. Since we are the first and last associates to interact with customers, 
  I have developed my ability to engage with customers in a way that makes them feel at ease and want to keep coming back to our store.
